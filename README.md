# Web based Augmented Reality/WebAR using AR.JS, AFrame and Google Poly

A really simple example to demonstrate the ease and use of AR.js,AFrame and Google Poly for creating Web based Augmented Reality experience. 

**Prerequisites:**
- A mobile phone with rear camera
- Grant Camera Permissions when prompted in the browser!

**What you'll find**
- The AR marker is assumed to be vertical on a flatscreen device, hence the scene is rotated accordingly
    - Example covers : 
        - Creating & Setting Scene Params
        - Use of Lights and Shadows in the scene
        - Loading OBJ models from Google Poly
        - Adding Multiple Simple Animations based on different properties
        - Making use of Kanji marker.

        Scan the Kanji marker on the blog post : **"Escape the flatland using Augmented/Virtual Reality"** <- Google it
